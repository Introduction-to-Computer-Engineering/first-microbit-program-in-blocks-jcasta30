# Description:
This program is a simple version of the Flappy Bird game but for micro:bit. Basically, the goal of the game is to move the continously moving, flying bird (single dot), between upcoming sets of obstacles. Also, avoid hitting an obstacle, because if you don't it's Game Over! This program contains simple game mechanics, arrays, and loops.

P.S: To restart the game, press both the A + B buttons.
