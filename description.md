# Description:
This program is a simple version of the Flappy Bird game but for micro:bit. Basically, the goal of the game is to move the flying bird (single dot), which is moving continuously, between upcoming sets of obstacles. Also, avoid hitting an obstacle, because if you don't it's Game Over! This program contains simple game mechanics, arrays, and loops.
